[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mylog00/petrovich-kotlin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mylog00/petrovich-kotlin)

Petrovich-Kotlin is library which inflects Russian names to given grammatical case. It supports first names, last names and middle names inflections.

Petrovich-Kotlin is Kotlin implementation of [Petrovich](https://github.com/petrovich/petrovich-ruby) ruby gem.

P.S. Most code was ported from [NPetrovich](https://github.com/petrovich/petrovich-net).
But maybe I rewrite it better. And now we have what we have.
